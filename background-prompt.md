```
A minimalist, ultra-clean dark workstation setup in a professional digital engineering studio. Pure black matte desk surface with a sleek ultra-wide monitor displaying elegant JavaScript/React code syntax in soft white text on dark background. The monitor has thin bezels and is positioned low in the frame. Subtle technological grid pattern barely visible on the wall behind. Soft, diffused cinematic lighting from above creating gentle shadows. Deep depth-of-field with the workstation slightly blurred. Dark vignette around edges for focus. The environment is charcoal-gray and pure black with microscopic steel gray accents. 5% intensity soft blue reflections on monitor frame only. Photorealistic, high-resolution, sharp but matte surfaces. Enterprise-level digital studio atmosphere with extensive negative space on left and right sides for UI overlay. No people, no hands, no reflections, no clutter.
